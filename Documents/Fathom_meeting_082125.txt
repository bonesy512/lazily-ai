Meeting Purpose

Discuss and refine the user interface for a real estate contract generation tool.

Key Takeaways

  - Current template-based system (70+ fields in spreadsheet) is not user-friendly for realtors
  - Shift focus from bulk processing to individual contract creation with pre-populated fields
  - Implement a questionnaire-style UI with toggles, buttons, and save options for frequent data
  - Prioritize ease of use for realtors with varying levels of experience and contract familiarity

Topics

Current System Overview

  - $10/month subscription model with credit system
  - Template available for download (Google Sheets/Excel)
  - 70+ fields to fill out, including repetitive information
  - Bulk upload feature available but may not be widely used
  - PDF generation from uploaded data

User Interface Concerns

  - Spreadsheet template not intuitive for average users
  - True/False inputs for certain fields (e.g., addenda) may confuse users
  - Text cutoff issues in generated PDFs need addressing
  - Bulk processing may not be necessary for most users (1 contract/week or month)

Proposed UI Improvements

  - Implement a questionnaire-style form for data entry
  - Add toggle switches and buttons for binary choices (e.g., "buyer pays title policy")
  - Include "save for future use" options for frequently repeated data
  - Pre-populate ~70% of fields based on user's standard contract info
  - Focus on changing only necessary fields (e.g., sales price, earnest money) for each contract

User Perspectives

  - Trent (realtor): Supports questionnaire approach for ease of use
  - Anthony: Suggests saving seller info, using buttons for binary choices, and pre-populating standard fields
  - Thomas: Recognizes need for more user-friendly interface, especially for less tech-savvy realtors

Next Steps

  - Redesign UI to incorporate questionnaire-style form with toggles and buttons
  - Implement save feature for frequently used data
  - Create initial setup process to gather user's standard contract information
  - Address PDF generation issues (text cutoff, field alignment)
  - Reconvene in a few days to review updated design
Action Items
  - Redesign UI for contract gen system - questionnaire format, pre-fill options, toggles for saving common info. Prepare for review in few days.  - WATCH (5 secs): https://fathom.video/share/_UD_-K2Ydfwbq-jCtzqs88UPdQUkZQxS?timestamp=805.9999
