Strategic Analysis: CSV Upload vs. Web Form


Feature
	CSV Template Upload
	Single Web Form
	Best For
	Bulk Processing (10-10,000 contracts at once)
	Single Entry (1-5 contracts) or casual users
	User Experience
	Low (error-prone, requires external software)
	High (intuitive, guided, no special software)
	Data Validation
	Post-upload (user submits and then finds errors)
	Real-time (inline error messages, format enforcement)
	Efficiency at Scale
	Extremely High (copy-paste, formulas, quick edits)
	Extremely Low (repetitive manual data entry)
	Onboarding
	Difficult (users must learn the exact template format)
	Easy (the form guides the user)
	The core conflict is clear: the most efficient method for bulk work is the least user-friendly, and the most user-friendly method is useless for bulk.


The Hybrid Solution: A Multi-Modal Input System


Instead of choosing one over the other, we should implement a more sophisticated system that caters to different user needs. Here's a phased blueprint:


Phase 1: The Single Contract Form (The Quick Win)


First, we build the web form you're envisioning. This serves as the primary entry point for new users and those who only need to generate a handful of contracts.
* UI/UX: A clean, multi-step form built with shadcn/ui components (Input, Date Picker, Checkbox, etc.).
* Functionality:
   * Real-time validation for all fields (e.g., ensuring dollar amounts are numbers, dates are valid).
   * Tooltips and helper text explaining specific fields (e.g., "Legal Description of the Property").
   * At the end of the form, the user can either generate the single contract or "Add to a new Bulk List."


Phase 2: The Intelligent Import Wizard (Improving the CSV)


We transform the current "upload and pray" CSV method into a guided, interactive experience.
* UI/UX: A modal or dedicated page that manages the import process.
* Functionality:
   1. Flexible Column Mapping: The user uploads their CSV. The wizard automatically maps columns like "Buyer Name" or "Purchaser" to the system's buyer_name field. It shows the user the mapping and allows them to manually correct any mismatches.
   2. Data Preview & Validation: The system shows the first 10-20 rows of the imported data in a table. It runs validations and visually flags errors (e.g., highlighting a cell with an invalid date in red).
   3. In-Browser Correction: The user can click on a flagged cell and correct the data directly in the web interface without having to go back to Excel, fix the CSV, and re-upload.
   4. Save & Process: Once all validation errors are resolved, the user approves the import for bulk processing.


Phase 3: The In-App Spreadsheet (The Power User Feature)


This is the ultimate solution that combines the ease of a web app with the power of a spreadsheet.
* UI/UX: Implement an interactive, in-browser table component (like AG-Grid or a custom-built one).
* Functionality:
   * Users can create a new "Contract List" and add rows directly.
   * They can copy-paste data directly from Excel into this table.
   * Each cell would have the appropriate input type (a date picker for dates, a dropdown for options, etc.).
   * Validation would happen instantly as they type.
This hybrid model ensures that Lazily.ai is both incredibly easy to use for the simplest task (one contract) and incredibly powerful for its core purpose (hundreds of contracts), truly delivering on an "effortless" experience.
