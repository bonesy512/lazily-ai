In Texas real estate, the "Option Period" is a critical, buyer-friendly feature of the TREC 1-4 contract. It's a negotiated window of time during which the buyer has the unrestricted right to terminate the contract for any reason. This right is purchased for a fee, known as the Option Fee.

### What is the Option Fee?

The Option Fee is a non-refundable amount paid by the buyer directly to the seller. It is consideration for the seller taking the property off the market for the duration of the Option Period.

- **Amount:** The fee is negotiable. It can be anything from $100 to several thousand dollars, depending on the price of the home and market conditions.
- **Delivery:** Per Paragraph 5 of the contract, the Option Fee must be delivered to the Escrow Agent within 3 days of the contract's Effective Date.

### How Termination Works

If the buyer decides to terminate, they must give written notice to the seller *before* 5:00 PM (local time where the property is located) on the last day of the Option Period.

- **If you terminate:** You lose the Option Fee (the seller keeps it), but your Earnest Money is refunded.
- **If you proceed:** The Option Fee is typically credited to the sales price at closing.

The Option Period is one of the most powerful tools a buyer has in Texas. It provides a low-cost "out" if the property isn't what it seems, making it an essential part of a smart and safe real estate purchase.
