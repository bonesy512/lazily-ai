    ---

    The TREC 1-4 Family Residential Contract is the bedrock of most residential real estate deals in Texas. For wholesalers, mastering this form isn't just about compliance; it's about creating a clear, enforceable agreement that protects your interests and facilitates a smooth assignment. This guide will walk you through the critical fields from a wholesaler's perspective.

    ### Section 1: Parties

    This seems simple, but it's where the foundation is laid.

    - **Seller:** This is the current owner of the property. Ensure the name matches the deed exactly.
    - **Buyer:** This is **your entity** (e.g., "Your Investing LLC") or your name. Crucially, you should add `"and/or assigns"` after your name or entity. This language explicitly puts the seller on notice that you may assign your rights in the contract to another buyer. Example: `John Doe and/or assigns`.

    ### Section 5: Earnest Money and Option Fee

    This is where you demonstrate seriousness and secure your exit ramp.

    - **Earnest Money:** A reasonable amount to show good faith. For many wholesale deals, this can be as low as $100 to $500.
    - **Option Fee & Period:** This is a wholesaler's most powerful tool. Pay a nominal Option Fee (e.g., $100) for an Option Period of at least 14-30 days. This gives you the unrestricted right to terminate the contract for any reason, providing you time to find an end-buyer without being locked in.

    ### Section 11: Special Provisions

    **Crucial rule:** Real estate agents are prohibited from adding business details here, but as a principal in the transaction (the buyer), you can. This is where you can add specific wholesaling clauses. A common one is a disclosure clause:

    > "Buyer is a real estate investor and intends to assign this contract to another buyer. Seller acknowledges this intent."

    This provides full transparency and can prevent disputes later.
